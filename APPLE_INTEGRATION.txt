1. For iOS:
   Open your project in Xcode (Runner.xcworkspace).
   In the Project Navigator (left sidebar), select the Runner target.
   Drag and drop the hand_landmarker.task file into the Runner group/folder within the Project Navigator.
   When prompted, ensure that "Copy items if needed" is checked and that the file is added to the Runner target.
   You can verify this by checking the "Build Phases" tab for the Runner target, under "Copy Bundle Resources". The hand_landmarker.task file should be listed there.
